## Introduction
As an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, I embarked on a journey to interpret real-world data and make crucial business decisions. This project involves exploring transactional data, unraveling sales trends, understanding customer behavior, and identifying popular products.

## Case Study
In this endeavor, my objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis, unveil patterns, outliers, and correlations, and provide actionable insights. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I aim to optimize the store's operations and enhance customer satisfaction in the competitive online retail market.
