<h1 align="center">Portfolio Project: Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python</h1>
<h3 align="left">In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, helping interpret real-world data to help make a key business decision.
<h3 align="left"> Case Study:
  
In this project, you will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. By conducting exploratory data analysis, you will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, you will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.</h3>

<h3 align="left"> Conclusion:
  
The customer with the highest number of orders comes from the United Kingdom (UK)
The company receives the highest number of orders from customers in the UK (since it is a UK-based company). Therefore, the TOP 5 countries (including UK) that place the highest number of orders are as below: United Kingdom Germany France Ireland (EIRE) Spain
November 2011 has the highest sales , highest active customer and highest order placed but has the minmum avg revenue
The month with the lowest sales is undetermined as the dataset consists of transactions until 9th December 2011 in December
The most of the sales on afternoon & lowest sales on night
There is almost 25% NA value present which is quite large and that would impact the result.
We have a large percentage of cancelled orders of 39.98%
Top 5 country who cancelled orders are: United Kingdom
Germany
EIRE
France
USA
Finding that new customer are generating more revenue as compare to old (existing).
Most people buy less than 25 items.
Number one product is white hanging heart T-light holder.
Not clear why there are FREE items given to certain customers On average, the company gave out 2-4 times FREE items to customers each month (Except in June 2011 & dec 2011 full data is not available)</h3>
<h3 align="left">Based on these results, here are some suggestion:
  
1)Focus on top markets: Since most of your orders come from the UK, Germany, France, Ireland (EIRE), and Spain, it might be a good idea to focus your marketing efforts on these markets.

2)Improve customer retention: Since new customers are generating more revenue than existing customers, it might be a good idea to focus on improving customer retention. This can be done by offering loyalty programs or personalized promotions.

3)Reduce cancelled orders: With a large percentage of cancelled orders, it might be a good idea to investigate why customers are cancelling their orders and take steps to reduce cancellations.

4)Clarify free item policy: Since it is not clear why certain customers are receiving free items, it might be a good idea to clarify your free item policy to ensure that all customers are treated fairly.</h3>
